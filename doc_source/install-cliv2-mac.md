# Installing the AWS CLI version 2 on macOS<a name="install-cliv2-mac"></a>

This section describes how to install, upgrade, and remove the AWS CLI version 2 on macOS\.

**Important**  
Because AWS CLI versions 1 and 2 use the same `aws` name for the command, your computer will find only the first one found in your search path if you have both installed\. If you previously had AWS CLI version 1 installed, then we recommend that you do one of the following to use AWS CLI version 2:  
***Recommended:*** Uninstall AWS CLI version 1 and use only AWS CLI version 2\.
Use your operating system's ability to create an alias or link with a different namef or one of the two `aws` commands\. For example, you could use [https://www.linux.com/tutorials/understanding-linux-links/](https://www.linux.com/tutorials/understanding-linux-links/) or [https://www.linux.com/tutorials/aliases-diy-shell-commands/](https://www.linux.com/tutorials/aliases-diy-shell-commands/) in Linux and macOS or []() in Windows\.

## Prerequisites<a name="cliv2-mac-prereq"></a>
+ The AWS CLI version 2 has no dependencies on other software packages\. It has a self\-contained, embedded copy of all dependencies included in the installer\. You no longer need to install and maintain Python to use the AWS CLI\.
+ We support the AWS CLI version 2 on versions of macOS that are supported by Apple, including High Sierra \(10\.13\), Mojave \(10\.14\), and Catalina \(10\.15\)\.

## Installing<a name="cliv2-mac-install"></a>

You can install using either the graphical interface or the command line\.<a name="cliv2-mac-install-gui"></a>

## Installing using the macOS graphical interface<a name="cliv2-mac-install-gui"></a>

To install using the standard macOS graphical interface and your browser, follow these steps:

1. Using your browser, download this file: [https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg)\.

1. Double\-click the downloaded file to launch the installer\.

1. Follow the on\-screen instructions\.

1. Follow the steps in the section [Confirming the installation](#cliv2-mac-install-confirm) below\.<a name="cliv2-mac-install-cmd"></a>

## Installing using the macOS command line<a name="cliv2-mac-install-cmd"></a>

You can also download and install from the command line\.

We provide the steps in one easy to copy and paste group\. See the descriptions of each line in the steps that follow\. 

```
$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
$ sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
```

1. Download the file using the `curl` command\. The options on the following example command cause the downloaded file to be written to the current directory with the local name \.

   ```
   $ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
   ```

   In this example, the `-o` option specifies the file name that the downloaded package is written to\. In the previous example, the file is written to `AWSCLIV2.pkg` in the current folder\.

   In this example the latest version of the CLI is downloaded\. A version can be specified by appending it just before the file extension: `https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2-2.x.y.pkg`

1. Run the standard macOS `installer` program, specifying the downloaded \.pkg file as the source\.

   ```
   $ sudo installer -pkg ./AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
   ```

   You must specify the name of the package to install by using the `-pkg` parameter, and the drive to which to install the package by using the `-target /` parameter\. The files are installed to `/usr/local/aws-cli`, and a symlink is created in `/usr/local/bin`\. You must include `sudo` on the command to grant write permissions to those folders\. 

## Confirming the installation<a name="cliv2-mac-install-confirm"></a>

Confirm the installation\. The following commands verify that the shell can find the `aws` command in your path, and that the command can actually run\.

```
$ which aws
/usr/local/bin/aws 
$ aws --version
aws-cli/2.0.0 Python/3.7.4 Darwin/18.7.0 botocore/2.0.0
```

## Upgrading<a name="cliv2-mac-upgrade"></a>

To upgrade your copy of the AWS CLI version 2, run the same steps that you used to install it in the previous section\. Download and run the package\. If it finds that the AWS CLI is already installed, then it automatically overwrites and upgrades the existing installation\.

## Uninstalling<a name="cliv2-mac-remove"></a>

To uninstall the AWS CLI version 2, run the following commands, substituting the paths you used to install\.

Find the folder that contains the symlinks to the main program and the completer\.

```
$ which aws
/usr/local/bin/aws
```

Use that information to find the installation folder that the symlinks point to\.

```
$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/aws
lrwxrwxrwx 1 ec2-user ec2-user 49 Oct 22 09:49 /usr/local/bin/aws -> /usr/local/aws-cli/aws
```

Now delete the two symlinks in the first folder\. If your user account already has write permission to these folders, you don't need to use `sudo`\.

```
$ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/aws
$ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/aws_completer
```

Finally, you can delete the main installation folder\. Use `sudo` to gain write access to the `/usr/local` folder\.

```
$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/aws-cli
```
